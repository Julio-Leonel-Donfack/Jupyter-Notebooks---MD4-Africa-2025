# Jupyter-Notebooks---MD4-Africa-2025
The Marine Data 4 Africa 2025 program aims to enhance the collection and use of marine data in Africa to promote sustainable ocean and marine resource management, focusing on climate change, marine ecosystem conservation, and improving the livelihoods of coastal populations.

The tutorial on the Gulf of Guinea and the monsoon system, presented by Alexandre Homerin from Noveltis, explored the climatic impact on the region using data analysis tools. The event, organized by Mercator Ocean International and the Copernicus Marine Team from March 3-5, 2025, also provided insights into advanced marine resource management and the marine data network. Sessions focused on mapping, programming, and modeling tools to support sustainable ocean management.
